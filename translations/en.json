  "portfoliotitle1": "Remote heart rate monitoring system for the elderly",
  "portfoliodesc1": "For this project, I developed a remote heart rate monitoring system specially designed for the elderly, enabling the patient's ECG to be viewed in real time. The system is based on a MERN Stack architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for data processing and display, and on the MQTT protocol for communication between the sensors and the server. The sensors used include the DHT11 for measuring temperature and humidity, and the AD8232 for capturing ECG signals, all connected via an ESP32 module. The application offers an intuitive user interface developed with React, enabling real-time monitoring of physiological data through an interactive dashboard. In addition to the continuous visualisation of ECG data, the system features an alert mechanism for any anomalies detected in the data collected, ensuring rapid intervention in the event of a problem. Using the MQTT protocol, information from the sensors is transmitted smoothly and efficiently to the server, ensuring stable and reliable communication. This project aims to improve the quality of life of the elderly by offering them remote medical monitoring, while facilitating access by healthcare professionals to accurate, up-to-date data.

  "portfoliotitle2": "Maternity management",
  "portfoliodesc2": "The management project for a maternity hospital is a web application currently under development, designed to optimise patient management and birth management. Using the MERN Stack, which combines MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js, this system offers an intuitive and responsive interface, allowing users to navigate easily between the various functionalities. Key features include secure authentication for medical staff, ensuring that only authorised users can access sensitive data. An administrator dashboard is also in place for efficient management of patient records, with the ability to view and edit medical information, as well as track births in real time. In addition, the system will enable staff accounts to be managed, ensuring smooth, centralised administration of maternity operations. By integrating these functionalities, this project aims to improve the quality of care offered to patients and simplify administrative processes, thus contributing to a more efficient working environment for medical staff",
  "portfoliotitle3": "Automatic Message Sending Application for SPADON Customers",
  "portfoliodesc3": "The automatic messaging application project enables companies to optimise their communication with customers via e-mail and WhatsApp messages. Built using Java EE, the application uses cron jobs to automatically execute classes, ensuring that messages are sent regularly and without manual intervention. To send e-mails, the application integrates Google's SMTP API, ensuring reliable and secure delivery of e-mail communications. At the same time, it uses the Meta for Developers WhatsApp API to facilitate the sending of WhatsApp messages, allowing businesses to reach their customers on the most popular messaging platform. Security is a priority in this project, so we have implemented robust security measures at both the application and Tomcat levels to ensure that all communications are protected from unauthorised access. With this application, companies can automate their interactions, improve customer engagement and optimise their communication processes while ensuring a high level of security.",
  "portfoliotitle4": "Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions in C (BNF Grammar)",
  "portfoliodesc4": "The arithmetic expression evaluation project is an application developed in the C language, aimed at implementing a system capable of analysing and calculating arithmetic expressions while respecting the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar. The system is designed to interpret expressions accurately and efficiently, guaranteeing correct evaluation of operations. The main features of this application include a robust syntactic analysis of expressions, enabling the different arithmetic components to be identified and processed. Expressions are calculated according to operator priority, ensuring that operations are performed in the correct order. In addition, the system includes effective syntax error handling, allowing the user to receive clear messages in the event of invalid entries. This completed project demonstrates a structured and methodical approach to handling arithmetic expressions, providing a solid foundation for any application requiring complex calculations",
  "portfoliotitle5": "Redesign of the Spadon website",
  "portfoliodesc5": "The Spadon website redesign project is currently underway, aiming to modernise the interface and improve the user experience. To do this, we're using a full JavaScript approach to HTML page development, creating a custom framework tailored to Spadon's specific needs. The redesign involves a complete overhaul of the site, providing fluid, intuitive navigation while incorporating modern, responsive features. The choice of a customised framework allows us to design bespoke solutions that are optimised for performance and usability, while guaranteeing greater interactivity for users",
